The pipeline can be run in RNAseq, tumor only and tumor-normal modes. // insert pipeline overview image // 2.1 Quality Control \u00b6 FastQC is a program designed to spot potential problems in high througput sequencing datasets. It provides an overview of basic quality control metrics for raw next generation sequencing data. The output is a html file summarizing several read statistics like Per base seqeunce quality, Per base GC content, Per seqeunce GC content, sequence length distribution, duplicated sequences and over represented sequences. Picard provides a high level metrics about the alignment of reads within a SAM/BAM file. This tool takes a SAM/BAM file input and produces metrics detailing the quality of the read alignments as well as the proportion of the reads that passed machine signal-to-noise threshold quality filters. RNAseQC The RNA-SeQC package has functions for computing various quality metrics, such as alignment quality, duplication rates, GC bias, rRNA content, coverage continuity, covered alignment regions, transcript count, and 3'/5' bias. It produces Read counts, coverage, correlation quality control metrics, and is also suitable for use with scRNA-seq data sets.

Overview \u00b6 RNA-sequencing has wide variety of applications. The power of sequencing RNA lies in the fact that the twin aspects of discovery and quantification can be combined in a single high-throughput sequencing assay called RNA-sequencing. RNA-seq can be coupled with different types of biochemical assay to analyze many other aspects of RNA biology, such as RNA\u2013protein binding, RNA structure, or RNA\u2013RNA interactions. This pipeline presents optimal methods for transcript quantification, fusion detection, variant analysis and QC. 2. Mapping \u00b6 STAR aligner is designed to specifically address many of the challenges of RNA-seq data mapping using a strategy to account for spliced alignments. STAR aligns the non-contiguous sequences directly to the reference genome. We use STAR \"TwopassMode\"; in the first pass, the novel junctions are detected and inserted into the genome indices. In the second pass, all reads will be re-mapped using annotated (from the GTF file) and novel (detected in the first pass) junctions. While this doubles the run time, it significantly increases sensitivity to novel splice junctions. The genome versions and the tool versions are listed here . We generate two bam files from the STAR alignment. Bam Purpose Transcriptome bam For gene Quantification Genome bam For variant analysis 3. Quantification \u00b6 RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for estimating gene and isoform expression levels from RNA-Seq data. The RSEM package supports threads for parallel computation of the EM algorithm, single-end and paired-end read data, quality scores, variable-length reads and RSPD estimation. In addition, it provides posterior mean and 95% credibility interval estimates for expression levels. 4. Fusion Detection \u00b6 Arriba is a command-line tool for the detection of gene fusions from RNA-Seq data. It is based on the ultrafast STAR aligner, and renders detailed quality visualizations of the transcripts involved in predicted fusions. It generates a PDF file with one page for each predicted fusion. Each page depicts the fusion partners, their orientation, the retained exons in the fusion transcript and statistics about the number of supporting reads. STAR-Fusion is a component of the Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT). STAR-Fusion uses the STAR aligner to identify candidate fusion transcripts supported by Illumina reads. STAR-Fusion further processes the output generated by the STAR aligner to map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set. STAR-Fusion can be run using fastq files as input or using the 'Chimeric.junction.out' file from STAR mapping. This pipeline uses the later technique. FusionCatcher searches for somatic novel/known fusion genes, translocations and/or chimeras in RNA-seq data. FusionCatcher achieves competitive detection rates and real-time PCR validation rates in RNA-sequencing data from tumor cells. 4. Variant Analysis \u00b6 5.
